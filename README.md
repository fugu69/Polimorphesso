# Polimorphesso ☕️

A fully object-oriented coffee shop simulation in Python — built step by step to embrace and demonstrate core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.

This playful yet structured project starts with a single `CoffeeShop` class and gradually evolves into a dynamic system with components like `Barista`, `CoffeeMachine`, `Order`, and more. The goal: build a maintainable, extensible codebase while exploring real-world OOP design in action.

---

## 🎯 Features (as the project evolves)
- Class composition with clean object relationships
- Inheritance to manage shared behaviors across staff roles
- Polymorphism in actions like making drinks or processing payments
- Real-world inspired methods like `brew_coffee()`, `take_order()`, `serve_customer()`
- Gradual complexity increase — commits reflect each learning step

## 🚀 Why Polimorphesso?

> Like a well-made espresso, good OOP design is balanced, refined, and energizing.

This project is brewed to:
- Practice clean, scalable OOP architecture
- Showcase Python class design in a fun domain
- Demonstrate OOP concepts through a creative, real-world simulation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.12+
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)
- Optional later: CLI interface, unit tests, maybe even a GUI

---

## 📂 Structure
As the system grows, expect files like:

polimorphesso/
├── coffee_shop.py
├── staff/
│ ├── barista.py
│ ├── cashier.py
├── machines/
│ └── espresso_machine.py
├── orders/
│ └── order.py
└── main.py

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Apply OOP practically in an evolving project
- Use composition over inheritance when it makes sense
- Think in systems and abstractions, not just scripts
